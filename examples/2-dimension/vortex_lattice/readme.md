The vortex lattice equal number of alternate vortices and antivortices in the system are imprinted using phase imprinting and in the abscense of any potential. 
The default total number of vortex and anti-vortex pairs  vortices in the system are 100(with equal and alternate vortex and antivortex pairs). The can be changed by changing the value of `Nvorts` in the `vortex_lattice()` funcion of the file `quTARANG/initial_cond/dimension2.py`
